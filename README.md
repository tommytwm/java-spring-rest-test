# java-spring-rest-test

## Dependencies:
1. Maven 4.0.0
2. Java Development Kit 8 or higher
3. Spring 2.2.6

## How to run:
On Terminal, make sure the root is **/app**, then enter the following:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
 ```

### Development Process:
I started by creating an empty Maven project on VSCode by making use of the extension in VSCode marketplace and pushing that
as an initial commit on my Github repo. After taking some cues from MVC (Model-View-Controller) design principles, I decided to start by making a model to handle reversal of strings. 

### TASK:

Implement a ReST API using Java and Spring Boot which has the following contract:
GET /reverse/<string> returns <string> reversed.

e.g. /reverse/orangepeel, returns leepegnaro

The code should be structured and built as a Maven project along with appropriate documentation and unit tests.

### Deliverables:
 • Complete Maven project.
 • A short explanation of your thought process – challenges, design choices.
 • Documentation where necessary.

If you have any questions or require clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out at any point.
